# Interpretable Collective Variables of the noisy Voter Model

This repository contains the code and numerical examples presented in the preprint "[Learning Interpretable Collective Variables of the Noisy Voter Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03491)".

To run the examples, first download the repository and install the needed Python packages via the command
```
pip install .
```
Alternatively, you can set up a virtual environment using `Poetry`.
After installing `Poetry`, run the command
```
poetry install
```
in the package directory.
The scripts for the three examples are 
- `examples/stochastic_block_model/main.py`
- `examples/ring/main.py`
- `examples/albert_barabasi/main.py`
